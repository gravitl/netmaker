Introduction
===============

Netmaker is a tool for creating and managing virtual overlay networks. If you have servers spread across multiple locations, data centers, or clouds, this platform can make life easier. Netmaker takes all those machines and puts them on a single, secure, flat network so that they can all talk to each other easily and securely. It's like a VPC but of arbitrary computers.

Netmaker can be compared to and covers use cases similar to Tailscale, ZeroTier, or Nebula, but Netmaker does more than that, while being faster, more dynamic and more flexible.

Netmaker uses kernel WireGuard to create encrypted tunnels between every node in your virtual network. Netmaker's `netclient` agent is self-updating and pulls any necessary changes (such as new peers) from the main server. 

Use Cases
=========
 1. Create a flat, secure network between multiple/hybrid cloud environments
 2. Integrate central and edge services
 3. Secure a home or office network while providing remote connectivity
 4. Manage cryptocurrency proof-of-stake machines
 6. Provide an additional layer of security on an existing network
 7. Encrypt Kubernetes inter-node communications
 8. Secure site-to-site connections


Compatible Systems
==================

To manage a server automatically, Netmaker requires **systemd-based linux.** Compatible systems include:
        - Fedora
        - Ubuntu
        - Debian
        - Mint
        - SUSE
        - RHEL
        - Raspian.
        - Arch
        - CentOS
        - CoreOS
      
To manage DNS (optional), the server must have systemd-resolved. Systems that have this enabled include:
        - Arch
        - Debian
        - Ubuntu
        - SUSE


In future releases, we will support other platforms such as Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and more.
