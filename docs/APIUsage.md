Most actions that can be performed via API can be performed via UI. We recommend managing your networks using the official netmaker-ui project. However, Netmaker can also be run without the UI, and all functions can be achieved via API calls. If your use case requires using Netmaker without the UI or you need to do some troubleshooting/advanced configuration, using the API directly may help.
